# note-map

A Next.js app for location based notes. Using the Google Maps API, users create a collection of notes that are pinned to a map for easy spatial referencing. I was inspired by "String Theory" boards from shows like HBO's The Wire, where detectives create a bulletin board using pins, string, pictures, and notes. I used this app to organize a search for an off-campus residence in Nashville for my senior year at Vanderbilt, but the use cases are endless! I am actively building new features.
